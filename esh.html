 <!--   Dear [Her Name],

I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much your friendship means to me. You’ve been my rock, my cheerleader, and the person who understands me better than anyone else. Whether we’re laughing over silly jokes or sharing deep conversations, every moment with you is priceless. Thank you for always being by my side and for being the incredible person you are. I’m so lucky to have you as my best friend!

With love,
[Your Name]-->
   My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue. ... </p1>
